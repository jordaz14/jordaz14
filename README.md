I graduated from The University of Texas at Austin in 2022 with a degree in financial engineering and statistics. Over the past two years, I've worked as an investment banking analyst at JP Morgan and a strategic finance analyst at 1stDibs. Driven to expand my technical skills beyond Excel, I began a self-directed journey in web development early last year, culminating in a recent intensive batch at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) developing end-to-end applications. I'm currently looking for roles in software development that leverage my background in finance, but I'm open to all opportunities that allow me to grow and contribute as a developer.
