## Hi, I'm JulianðŸ‘‹

I graduated from The University of Texas at Austin in 2022 with a degree in financial engineering and statistics. I spent the past two years working as an investment banking analyst at JP Morgan and a strategic finance analyst at 1stDibs. Looking to expand my technical skills beyond Excel, I began teaching myself programming and web development early last year. I recently completed a batch at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/), and I'm currently looking for roles in software development that complement my background in finance, but I'm open to all opportunities.
